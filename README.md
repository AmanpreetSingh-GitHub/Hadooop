This area contains resources related to Big Data and Hadoop.

- Hadoop Ecosystem.md: This document should be read as a basic guide to Hadoop ecosystem (with MapReduce as YARN Application)

- Hadoop Configuration for Pseudo-Distribution Mode Installation.md: This document contains detailed step-by-step information on Configuring Hadoop for Pseudo-Distribution Mode Installation

- First MapReduce project.md: This document contains the first MapReduce project and basics of MapReduce Job

- Second MapReduce project.md: This document contains the second MapReduce project that uses KeyValueTextInputFormat

- Third MapReduce project.md: This document contains our third MapReduce project that uses Custom Partitioner

- Fourth MapReduce project.md: This document contains our fourth MapReduce project that uses Custom Data Types

- Fifth MapReduce project.md: This document contains our fifth MapReduce project without Reducers

- MapReduce folder: This folder contains the necessary source code files (in Java) for our MapReduce projects

- Sqoop-Pig-Hive project1.md: This document contains an end-to-end project using Sqoop, Pig and Hive along with explaining their architecture

- SqoopPigHive_Project1: This folder contains necessary Data files and Script files related to "Sqoop-Pig-Hive project1" project

I am continuously adding more resources to this repository like:
- documents
- code files
- configuration information
- and more

Next I am working on (will share the documents and code shortly):
- Setting up Hadoop cluster in fully distributed mode

This repository will help anyone with no Hadoop knowledge to be comfortable working with Hadoop.

So keep revisiting this space.

Please send your comments or suggestions to my email.
