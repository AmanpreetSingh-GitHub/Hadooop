# Please Read

This area contains resources related to Big Data and Hadoop.

- Hadoop Ecosystem.docx: This document should be read as a basic guide to Hadoop ecosystem (with MapReduce as YARN Application)

- Hadoop Configuration for Installation.docx: This document contains detailed step-by-step information on Configuring Hadoop for Pseudo-Distribution Mode Installation

- First MapReduce project.docx: This document contains the first MapReduce project and basics of MapReduce Job

- Second MapReduce project.docx: This document contains the second MapReduce project that uses KeyValueTextInputFormat

I am continuously adding more resources to this repository like:
- documents
- code files
- configuration information
- and more

Next I am working on (will share the documents and code shortly):
- MapReduce project that uses Custom Partitioner
- MapReduce project that uses Custom Data Types
- MapReduce project without Reducers
- An End-to-end project using Sqoop, Pig and Hive along with explaining their architecture
- And setting up Hadoop cluster in fully distributed mode

This repository will help anyone with no Hadoop knowledge to be comfortable working with Hadoop.

So please keep revisiting this space.

Please send your comments or suggestions to my email.

Thanks
